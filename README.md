Developers are often tasked with creating interfaces that make it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in databases. Often these interfaces are known as **C**ontent **M**anagement **S**ystems. In this homework assignment, your challenge is to architect and build a solution for managing a company's employees using node, inquirer, and MySQL.

User Story:

```
As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
So that I can organize and plan my business
```

* The command-line application should allow users to:

  * Add departments, roles, employees

  * View departments, roles, employees

  * Update employee roles

  * Update employee managers

  * View employees by manager

  * Delete departments, roles, and employees

  * View the total utilized budget of a department -- ie the combined salaries of all employees in that department
